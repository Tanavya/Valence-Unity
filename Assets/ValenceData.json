Unlike the hydroxides of aluminum and lead, zinc hydroxide also dissolves in excess aqueous ammonia to form a colorless, water-soluble ammine complex.\nZinc hydroxide will dissolve because the ion is normally surrounded by water ligands; when excess sodium hydroxide is added to the solution the hydroxide ions will reduce the complex to a \u22122 charge and make it soluble. When excess ammonia is added, it sets up an equilibrium which provides hydroxide ions; the formation of hydroxide ions causes a similar reaction as sodium hydroxide and creates a +2 charged complex with a co-ordination number of 4 with the ammonia ligands - this makes the complex soluble so that it dissolves.\nOne major use is as an absorbent in surgical dressings.", "Sodium Bromide": "Sodium bromide is an inorganic compound with the formula NaBr.

It is synthetically produced in large quantities from salt (sodium chloride) and limestone by a method known as the Solvay process.\nThe manufacture of glass is one of the most important uses of sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate acts as a flux for silica, lowering the melting point of the mixture to something achievable without special materials. This \"soda glass\" is mildly water-soluble, so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass produced insoluble. This type of glass is known as soda lime glass: \"soda\" for the sodium carbonate and \"lime\" for the calcium carbonate. Soda lime glass has been the most common form of glass for centuries.\nSodium carbonate is also used as a relatively strong base in various settings. For example, it is used as a pH regulator to maintain stable alkaline conditions necessary for the action of the majority of photographic film developing agents. It acts as an alkali because when dissolved in water, it dissociates into the weak acid: carbonic acid and the strong alkali: sodium hydroxide. This gives sodium carbonate in solution the ability to attack metals such as aluminium with the release of hydrogen gas.\nIt is a common additive in swimming pools used to raise the ph which can be lowered by chlorine tablets and other additives which contains acids.\nIn cooking, it is sometimes used in place of sodium hydroxide for lyeing, especially with German pretzels and lye rolls. These dishes are treated with a solution of an alkaline substance to change the pH of the surface of the food and improve browning.\nIn taxidermy, sodium carbonate added to boiling water will remove flesh from the skull or bones of trophies to create the \"European skull mount\" or for educational display in biological and historical studies.\nIn chemistry, it is often used as an electrolyte. Electrolytes are usually salt-based, and sodium carbonate acts as a very good conductor in the process of electrolysis. In addition, unlike chloride ions, which form chlorine gas, carbonate ions are not corrosive to the anodes. It is also used as a primary standard for acid-base titrations because it is solid and air-stable, making it easy to weigh accurately.", "Sodium Oxide": "Sodium oxide is a chemical compound with the formula Na2O. It is used in ceramics and glasses, though not in a raw form. It is the base anhydride of sodium hydroxide, so when water is added to sodium oxide NaOH is produced.\nNa2O + H2O \u2192 2 NaOH\nThe alkali metal oxides M2O (M = Li, Na, K, Rb) crystallise in the antifluorite structure. In this motif the positions of the anions and cations are reversed relative to their positions in CaF2, with sodium ions tetrahedrally coordinated to 4 oxide ions and oxide cubically coordinated to 8 sodium ions.", "Zinc Fluoride": "Zinc fluoride (ZnF2) is an inorganic chemical compound. It is encountered as the anydrous form and also as the tetrahydrate, ZnF2 \u00b7 4H2O (rhombohedral crystal structure). It has a high melting point and has the rutile structure containing 6 coordinate zinc, which suggests appreciable ionic character in its chemical bonding. Unlike the other zinc halides, ZnCl2, ZnBr2 and ZnI2, it is not very soluble in water.", "Ammonium Nitride": "Ammonium nitride is not a naturally occuring compound. Theoretically, it is formed when 3 ammonium ions combine with 1 nitride ion.", "Ammonium Hydride": "Ammonium hydride is not a naturally occuring compound. Theoretically, it is formed when 1 ammonium ion combines with 1 hydride ion.", "Zinc Nitride": "Zinc nitride (Zn3N2) is an inorganic compound of zinc and nitrogen, usually obtained as (blue)grey crystals. It is a semiconductor. In pure form, it has the anti-bixbyite structure.", "Calcium Hydride": "Calcium hydride is the chemical compound with the formula CaH2, and is therefore an alkaline earth hydride. This grey powder (white if pure, which is rare) reacts vigorously with water liberating hydrogen gas. CaH2 is thus used as a drying agent, i.e. a desiccant.\nCaH2 is a saline hydride, meaning that its structure is salt-like. The alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals all form saline hydrides. A well-known example is sodium hydride, which crystallizes in the NaCl motif. These species are insoluble in all solvents with which they do not react. CaH2 crystallizes in the PbCl2 (cotunnite) structure.", "Zinc Sulfate": "Zinc sulfate is an inorganic compound and dietary supplement. As a supplement it is used to treat zinc deficiency and to prevention the conditions in those at high risk. Side effects may include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and feeling tired.\nIt has the formula ZnSO4 as well as any of three hydrates. It was historically known as \"white vitriol\". All of the various forms are colourless solids. The heptahydrate is commonly encountered.", "Aluminium Fluoride": "Aluminium fluoride (AlF3) is an inorganic compound used primarily in the production of aluminium. This colorless solid can be prepared synthetically but also occurs in nature.", "Lithium Hydride": "Lithium hydride is an inorganic compound with the formula LiH. This alkali metal hydride is a colorless solid, although commercial samples are grey. Characteristic of a salt-like, or ionic, hydride, it has a high melting point and is not soluble but reactive with all organic and protic solvents; it is soluble and non-reactive with certain molten salts such as lithium fluoride, lithium borohydride, and sodium hydride. With a molecular mass of slightly less than 8, it is the lightest ionic compound.", "Sodium Fluoride": "Sodium fluoride (NaF) is a chemical compound and medication. As a medication it is primarily used to prevent tooth decay in children older than 6 months in areas where the drinking water is low in fluoride. Sodium fluoride is used as a liquid, pill, or paste by mouth with this use being known as fluoride therapy.\nNormal doses may occasionally result in white marks on the teeth. Excessive doses can result in brown or yellow coloring of the teeth. It is believed to work mostly through direct contact with the teeth. Sodium fluoride is a colorless solid. It is most often made by mixing fluorosilicic acid with sodium hydroxide.\nSodium fluoride came into use to prevent tooth decay in the 1940s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. In the United Kingdom a typical month supply costs the NHS about 0.36 pounds. It is also commonly used for water fluoridation and added to toothpaste.", "Aluminium Oxide": "Aluminium oxide or Aluminum oxide (in U.S. English) is a chemical compound of aluminium and oxygen with the chemical formula Al2O3. It is the most commonly occurring of several aluminium oxides, and specifically identified as aluminium(III) oxide. It is commonly called alumina, and may also be called aloxide, aloxite, or alundum depending on particular forms or applications. It occurs naturally in its crystalline polymorphic phase \u03b1-Al2O3 as the mineral corundum, varieties of which form the precious gemstones ruby and sapphire. Al2O3 is significant in its use to produce aluminium metal, as an abrasive owing to its hardness, and as a refractory material owing to its high melting point.", "Magnesium Chloride": "Magnesium chloride is the name for the chemical compound with the formula MgCl2 and its various hydrates MgCl2(H2O)x. These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water.
